        Lauderdale Suzuki Group is a Suzuki programme run by a team of Suzuki
        violin teachers, musicianship teachers and pianists in North London.
        Founded by Elisabeth Waterhouse in 1978, we started with only about 30
        children and have now expanded to around 80 families. The Group takes
        its name from the fine 17th century building, Lauderdale House, which is
        situated on the edge of Waterlow Park in Highgate. The Groups run every
        Wednesday during term time, from 3.55 pm until 7 pm. All children and
        parents learning in Lauderdale Groups also take a weekly individual
        lesson with a qualified Suzuki teacher.
